# Act Orb [![CircleCI Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/CircleCI-Labs/act-orb.svg?style=shield "CircleCI Build Status")](https://circleci.com/gh/CircleCI-Labs/act-orb) [![CircleCI Orb Version](https://badges.circleci.com/orbs/cci-labs/act.svg)](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/cci-labs/act) [![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CircleCI-Labs/act-orb/master/LICENSE) [![CircleCI Community](https://img.shields.io/badge/community-CircleCI%20Discuss-343434.svg)](https://discuss.circleci.com/c/ecosystem/orbs)

The Act Orb allows developers to run GitHub Actions directly on CircleCI using the [Act CLI](https://nektosact.com/). This orb bridges the gap between GitHub Actions and CircleCI, enabling seamless CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions syntax while leveraging CircleCIâ€™s powerful infrastructure.  

This orb would not be possible without the contributors who have worked on the [Act CLI](https://nektosact.com/). 

## Features
- Execute GitHub Actions workflows within CircleCI.  
- Use familiar GitHub Actions syntax (`uses`, `with`, `env`).  
- Integrate with existing CircleCI pipelines.
- Leverage CircleCI caching for faster runs.

## How to Contribute

We welcome [issues](https://github.com/CircleCI-Labs/act-orb/issues) to and [pull requests](https://github.com/CircleCI-Labs/act-orb/pulls) against this repository!

## How to Publish An Update
1. Merge pull requests with desired changes to the main branch.
    - For the best experience, squash-and-merge and use [Conventional Commit Messages](https://conventionalcommits.org/).
2. Find the current version of the orb.
    - You can run `circleci orb info cci-labs/act | grep "Latest"` to see the current version.
3. Create a [new Release](https://github.com/CircleCI-Labs/act-orb/releases/new) on GitHub.
    - Click "Choose a tag" and _create_ a new [semantically versioned](http://semver.org/) tag. (ex: v1.0.0)
      - We will have an opportunity to change this before we publish if needed after the next step.
4.  Click _"+ Auto-generate release notes"_.
    - This will create a summary of all of the merged pull requests since the previous release.
    - If you have used _[Conventional Commit Messages](https://conventionalcommits.org/)_ it will be easy to determine what types of changes were made, allowing you to ensure the correct version tag is being published.
5. Now ensure the version tag selected is semantically accurate based on the changes included.
6. Click _"Publish Release"_.
    - This will push a new tag and trigger your publishing pipeline on CircleCI.
