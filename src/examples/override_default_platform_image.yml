  GitHub Actions offers managed virtual environments for running workflows. 
  In order for act to run your workflows locally, it must run a container for the runner defined in your workflow file.
  The default images do not contain all the tools that GitHub Actions offers by default in their runners due to size constraints. 
  You can override the default container by specifying a different image in the `platform` parameter.

  Please see Act's documentation for more details on available images: https://nektosact.com/usage/runners.html#default-runners-are-intentionally-incomplete
