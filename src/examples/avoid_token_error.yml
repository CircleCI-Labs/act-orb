  GitHub automatically provides a GITHUB_TOKEN secret when running workflows inside GitHub.
  If your workflow fails with an error about token, it most likely requires GITHUB_TOKEN to be set up.
  If your workflow depends on this token, you need to create a personal access token and pass it to the Act job.
  Please utilizes CircleCI's built in secret management and set GITHUB_TOKEN as environment variable. In this example
  CircleCI's contexts are used to inject the GITHUB_TOKEN secret into the Act job.

  Please see Act's documentation for more details on injecting secrets: https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html?highlight=matrix#secrets
